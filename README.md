# Insight-into-Aspirations
Overview: This research explores the intricate relationship between women's educational aspirations and desired family size, delving into the multifaceted dynamics that shape fertility choices. Using a Poisson Regression model and Negative Binomial model, I examined the impact of educational aspirations, education, religiosity, employment, and other factors on women's preferences regarding the number of children they wish to have. Findings reveal a significant and negative correlation, between aspirations and the number of children women desire to have, highlighting the influence of educational pursuits on fertility trajectories. Moreover, the research contributes to the existing literature by presenting a forward-looking model for understanding the complexity of women's aspirations and reproductive decisions. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and researchers interested in the intersection of education, career, and family planning, emphasizing the need for tailored support structures to accommodate the diverse aspirations of women in modern societies.

Data: I collected data using a Google form, which can be seen with this link (https://forms.gle/zpyB4VtDkH2W7iMd7). All variables were not used in the final model because some were not significant, regardless of the specifications attempted.

Methodology: The Poisson Maximum Likelihood estimation method was chosen, due to its ability to capture count data effectively. Under this method, the mean should be relatively close to the variance, which is generally the case with fertility data. The Poisson distribution is appropriate for non-negative integer data and is particularly useful when data has a right-skewed distribution, which is often the case with fertility data. The Negative Binomial model was used since the count data exhibits underdispersion. The NB model account is useful where the assumption of the Poisson model is violated, that assumption being the expected value being equal to the variance.
